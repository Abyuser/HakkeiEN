Hand drill.\nIt's a little expensive, but with improved heat resistance.\nthe rest...you should know what to do, right？
Hammer.\nBe careful, don't hit the wrong one.
Metal box.\nIf you want to scare a yukkuri without injuring them, you can\nhammer on the box with a yukkuri inside it.
Vibrator.\nArouses the yukkuri after a bit of contact with its skin.\nUseful if you want to expose its peni-peni.
Viyugra contract.\nA drug that arouses yukkuri upon consumption.\nPay-per-use.
Alcohol lamp.\nIt uses a special alcohol so it's only hot enough to burn a\nyukkuri and its accessories. Safe for humans！
Seat + Elastic of Punishment.\nThe elastic is for securing the yukkuri to the seat. Lying it\non its back leaves its mister hips and anyaru open for abyuse！
Nyutering kit.\nCut off a yukkuri's peni-peni. The peni-peni has to be\nexposed first, so I recommend a vibrator or viyugra.
Stalk shears.\nA special shape that crimps the cut surface to prevent bean paste from \nflowing out. Even for abyuse purpose, it's better to avoid incidents...
Razor.\nYukkuri hair is mostly sugar, so human razors aren't ideal.\nCareful, a shaved yukkuri might have a mental breakdown！
Ramune spray contract.\nPuts yukkuri to sleep immediately, like hand-fed ramune,\nbut without letting them taste the sweetness of ramune.
Anti-antiyukkuritis contract.\nA drug that prevents antiyukkuritis in a yukkuri for 1 day.\nFreezing a yukkuri also deactivates the drug. Pay-per-use.
