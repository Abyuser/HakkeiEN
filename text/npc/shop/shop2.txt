Come in！ We're still opening, so take it easy！
We have plenty of 「energetic」 high-resistance yukkuri！
With high durability they can stand more abuse…\nDoing that without killing is a man's dream！
It seems that yukkuri will not mourn the corpses of their\nfamily members, but will be disgusted by the death smell.
Let me tell you something: if you have concerns about the abuse\nleave a comment in my blog！

Hey, Come in.
Huh？ Looks like something is troubling you……
…… ……
I see, it's about very endurant yukkuri\nyou are dissatisfied that some can endure hammer blows……
Hehe……
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry. \nI didn't mean to laugh, I didn't know that you have the same issue\n I once had.
End the punishment when the yukkuri is half to death, 
End the punishment when the yukkuri is half to death, \ninstead of finishing it at its final moment…..
That would make a clown out of myself.
Hah…
Hah…\nIt's fine to let you know this,
You know that yukkuri's life is mostly supported by the paste core, right？
With a special kenpo, you can effectively penetrate the paste core\n with one blow.
By aimming at the paste core, this kenpo will display extraordianry power！
Let me teach you.
It's fine, no need to thank me.
It's fine, no need to thank me.\nIt's the old man's prerogative to guide the youngster.
Now, give it a try at your own place！
