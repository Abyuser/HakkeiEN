Apologies, I'm not dealing with badged yukkuri right now.
Truth is, the breeder that worked on this has retired…… ……
There's a lack of breeders, and a small shop like mine\ncan't afford a partnership.
What？ You have a breeder certificate！？
If you don't mind, will you sell your yukkuri here to make it a parent？\nEven bronze badges are fine.
By all means, thank you very much.
Waa！ It's a bronze badge！
It's amazing you have one so early！
This yukkuri will start a new lineage！ Please support me！

…… ……
…… ……！ …… ……！
…… ……Recently, the yukkuri market is focusing on yukkuri with \nhigh grade badges, so that there is no need for training.
Within the neighborhood, where yukkuri shops are more about the livelihood than breeding,\nby dealing with nothing but bronze badges you can only meet difficulties.
Wouldn't it benefit both parties if you were to sell the shop？
I refuse！
What about management improvements？\n…… ……if this shop were to disappear,\nwouldn't that trouble all the yukkuri owners of the area？
Well…… ……
…… ……
Oh, that's it！！\nThis breeder will provide you with a gold badged yukkuri！！
…… ……
That was rude of me.\nI thought I knew the face of a prominent breeder in the neighborhood,\nbut I didn't remember it…… ……
Oh, fine！！\nI'll have a talk with the breeder right now, please pick it up！！
…… ……
I understand. I'm sorry for today,\nPlease call me anytime if you change your mind.
…… ……
I just showed you something unsightly.\nI apologize for saying something weird…… ……
Oh, but if I don't say it, I'm not going to come back…… ……
I'm trying to enter the new market.\nIt seems to be the owner of a another yukkuri shop,\nbut I was told to sell the shop…… ……
I tried to refuse.\nI felt that way was right,\nand I came to a place to where I was panicking.
So…… ……
I would like you to become the owner of a high grade badged yukkuri.\nWhat..
No？
Eh？ You'll do it！？\nThank you！！
First of all, you can go to the silver badge class, so please！

Welcome
Thank you for hearing the impossible request the other day.\nIt's good for the bronze badges, and it's been taken care of …… ……
I also studied a lot so that I could rebuild the shop alone.\nI made a supplement that would support the health \nand growth of your yukkuri.
Based on the ingredients of high-grade sweets, it will provide the nutrients essential for the growth of yukkuri\nwith a diffrent approach from food.
We will keep it cheap, so please try using it！

Wow！ This is a silver badge！
It's amazing you have one so fast！
This yukkuri will start a new lineage！ Please support me！

Welcome
Oh, please listen to me！ I finally managed to breed silver \nbadged yukkuri！
The rest is to get a gold badge！ So please！

…… ……
You brought me a gold badged yukkuri…… ……
Thank you very very much！
After that, I will try my best！ \nSo please support me！

…… ……
The shop is more crowded than ever…… ……
Oh, welcome！ Just look at this！\nSuch a great view！
I have something to talk about with you, so could you wait for a moment？
…… ……
Thank you for waitingー. Ehehe. \nI finally managed to breed a gold badged yukkuri.
Although gold badged ones are priced higher, \nthey are quite popular beacuse it \ndoesn't require time to train them.
And they can help me on some simple cleaningー…… ……\nof course, you already knew that.
Thanks to you, the shop is becoming prosperous. \nThank you so much！
Talking about my appreciation, from now on,\n I will supply supplements to you at low price！

Would I like to go swimming in the sea with you？
Hmmー…… ……Sure, if it is with you.
Since tomorrow is the regular day off of the shop, \nshould we go there tomorrow immediately？

…… ……
Next day
…… ……
The water is cold and it feels greatー！
I'm not good at swimming, \nbut I'm glad I came here.
Because I'm with …… …… you？
Because I'm with …… …… you？\n…… ……Just kiddingー

I also prepared a bento, please have it！
