On yukkuri selection
The idea that breeders can rehabilitate scum yukkuri\nis faulty in regard to beginning breeders.\nRehabilitating scum yukkuri is extremely difficult, unless you have \nenough experience, the ones to be bred should be carefully picked.\n\nScolding or slight punishment is a good method to help on \ndetermining. After that, based on the reactions, \nyukkuri can be divided into four categories.\n\n1. [Reply rudely]  Sorry for the disappointment, but please \nignore this kind of yukkuri. After being punished many times,\nthat individual is probably a big scum if it still retaliates \nand fears no human violence.\n\n2. [why are you doing this?]  Be careful with this kind of \nyukkuri. [why are you mad?], a lot of yukkuri are incapable of \nunderstanding the reason even after explaining.\nJust make sure that the individual is not a scum.\n\n3. [Nothing more than crying] There is a very high possibility of \nbeing a retard. And the individual has no \nidea about what happened to itself. It is less likely to be \na scum, but low intelligence is quite troublesome for breeding.\n\n4. [Apologize] Probably not a scum.\nIf the individual is a sly one,\nthen there is the possibility of faking an apology to escape,\nbut it is still unlikely to be a scum yukkuri.\n\nNew breeders can repeat the above steps to judge yukkuri, \nas it is important to get used to breed non-scum yukkuri.
Methods of getting close to yukkuri
Like most animals that get along with human beings,\nyukkuri also have the tendency of getting attached to \nthe human who feed them, give yukkuri food at the \nmoment when it complains of being hungry, it will \nshow great gratitude and easiness to get close to.\n\nThe other method is to say the sentence [take it easy!],\nand there is a way to say it. \nYukkuri will feel happy since morning if it gets greeted \nafter waking up. A correct greeting after wakeup could even \nreduce scumminess. \n\nAlthough it may not worth mentioning that the greeting \nis verbal instead of being physical.\nYukkuri can get bored if it gets greeted too many \ntimes in a day. However, it will welcome the greetings \nas freshly as before if it sleeps overnight.\n\n
Methods of disciplining yukkuri
The two methods to discipline a yukkuri are scolding \nand corporal punishment. Pay attention to its affection when \nyou decide to scold. Just like human, you will \nnot listen to someone you cannot trust.\n\nPunishment has the better outcome than scolding despite \nthe risk of injury or death. In addition, yukkuri \nwill retaliate when it has low fearness to human. \nThe effective way for this situation is to shut the \nyukkuri in a metal box. Most yukkuri are afraid of \ncomplete darkness. By this way, yukkuri is not harmed in \nthe process, only fear is given. Despite that, \nsome individuals can still show resistance, just smash the \nmetal box with a hammer with no hesitation. \nThis sort of torment is also very effective against \nhuman, and it is sufficiently effective against all yukkuri!\n\nAfter all the explanations so far, it is still necessary \nto ensure that the disciplined yukkuri has a minimum \nlevel of intelligence. Let us use knowing go to the \ntoilet without specific instruction (scolding) as the standard. \nAlways keep an eye on that since the average IQ \nof yukkuri is very low.
On toilet
As long as the wild yukkuri is not a scum, \nit will do poopoo in a specified area. \nFor those yukkuri like cleanliness, \nit is unbearable to have poopoo in any visible \narea in the living environment. \n\nHowever, lowly intelligent yukkuri will do poopoo \nunder any situation, as [being easy] is the priority \nso the location is not its concern. \n\nYukkuri will start using the toilet if it has \nsufficient affection when gets scolded. \nIt will not follow the instruction when affection is low. \nAdditionaly, avoid punishment in this kind of occasion \nbecause Yukkuri will lose bowel control as a result \nof the impact, you will need to clean that up by yourself.
Types of yukkuri for beginners
The following types of yukkuri are easy to raise \nin the Yukkuarium: Marisa, Reimu, and Alice, \ntotal of three types. The idea of being easy to \nraise means the endurance to adapt to the environment \nof Yukkuarium, which is not related to the difficulty \nof breeding. Among the three types, Alice \nhas the possibility of becoming raper, beginner \nshould avoid of having multiple Alice at the same time.

Precautions for commanding yukkuri
There are lots of opportunities to ask yukkuri not to \ntake certain actions. Of course, if you do not have a relationship\nof trust with the yukkuri in the first place, \nit will refuse to obey. \n\nWarning, lowly intelligent yukkuri may not be able to \ncomprehend your order, and there are cases that it still \nsays it understands. It is quite simple to check if it \nactually knows the order, after it says [understood], \nbut may still perform the prohibited actions. \n\nThis behavior is not a showcase of being scummy, \nbut rather the intention to fulfill a relationship of trust. \nUnfortunately, it does not have the intelligence to understand \nthe command. In this case, an intellectual training \nshould be prioritized. 
On yukkuri reproduction
Yukkuri are highly fecund. Their sexual maturity come as \nthe same time as the appearance matures, so it is easy \nto judge. Reproduction is only allowed among the married couples, \nwith a few exceptions. The nature of reproduction does not \nchange for bred yukkuri. A marriage is performed when two \nyukkuri have deep attraction to each other. Although yukkuri are \nhermaphrodite, it seems that their sex is decided during the time \nof marriage. Coupled yukkuri reproduce relatively early. \nReproduction usually happens during the night when yukkuri \nwake up from sleeping. It often starts with inviting the lover to do \n[rub-rub]. After getting pregnant, a stalk will grow on the forehead \nof the mother, and the next gen of yukkuri will grow in \nthe form of fruit on the stalk. \n\nIf the stalk is cut due to an accident, you can put \nit in a bottle of sugar water, and it is still possible \nto grow up to the stage of koyukkuri without any adverse effects.\nAlso, yukkuri do not actively reproduce when they already have \ntheir offspring. However, they will restart breeding once \nkoyukkuri reach adulthood, as it is unlikely to have two sets of \noffspring at the same time. \n\nPlease be careful with overcrowding the breeding environment, \noccasions like abnormal pregnancy and mother dies together could \nhappen. This can also happen among wild yukkuri because of the \npolyphenism caused by overpopulation, it is highly possible \nthat a kind of apoptotic mechanism is triggered.
Yukkuri stress
Yukkuri are very stress sensitive. As [take it easy] is \nthe ultimate goal for yukkuri, anti-yukkuritis can \noccur when a yukkuri lives in a highly stressful environment. \nWhen catches anti-yukkuritis, a yukkuri abandons all voluntary \nactivities, and it will die eventually since no cure exists and no way \nto absorb any nutrition. \n\nAs a countermeasure, the anti-yukkuritis preventive drugs \nbeing sold on the market can be used. \nAlthough it does completely stop anti-yukkuritis from developing \nin a limited time, the stress will not disappear, so be careful.
Yukkuri constipation
Yukkuri, especially koyukkuri are very easy to have constipation \nwhen being bred. As a result, poopoo does not come out freely, \nand therefore causes a huge increase in stress. \nThe incidence of constipation depends on the food being fed to \nyukkuri, since the amount of water in yukkuri food is significantly \nlower than what wild yukkuri eat. Yukkuri food is \nnutritional and cheap, but counterplan against constipation is \nalso important if you use it as a main feeding source. \nThe simplest way is to set up a water feeder, and \nlet yukkuri hydrate by themselves. \nThere is another method that costs nothing, but it \nis limited to koyukkuri only. [Poo-poo dance] is a seemingly \nlaughable and meaningless move, it is actually a good method to \nsoften the bean paste and increase its fluidity. It seems \nthat poo-poo dance is an amusement move for yukkuri, \nso do not worry about getting declined \nas long as the yukkuri has poopoo in the body.

On mold
Mold is the main illness that happens to yukkuri. \nMold starts growing from the lower body when a yukkuri \nis exposed to unsanitary environment for too long. \nMold then gradually expands, and erodes the whole body. \nEventually, it kills the yukkuri when it infects the paste core. \nThe old cure is by burning the lower body with fire \nwhen it is at the initial state that only \nthe lower body has some mold. It is \nnot recommended because of the considerable \namount of stress it induces. \nNowadays, we have the official yukkuri clinics, which can \ntreat the mold safely with chemotherapy, and at the \nsame time, without creating any stress on yukkuri. \n\nAs a breeder, it is important keep yukkuri from getting mold. \nThe countermeasure is to keep yukkuri clean at all time. \nThe possibility of catching mold would be extremely low \nif the breeding environment was cleaned by removing feces \nregularly. Be caution, mold can develop quickly on physically \nweakened yukkuri during the rainy season, and yukkuri may \nstill suffer from the same fate unexpectedly during the other \nseasons with adequate health and same cleaning frequency. 
On playing water
Basically, all yukkuri like cleanliness and bathing.\nTherefore, small and shallow yukkuri pools are available on the \nmarket. However, it is important to note that yukkuri is a \ncreature that is very vulnerable to water. \nIndividual with good intelligence will leave the pool \nbefore its body gets soaked in water. \nLowly intelligent Individual will not notice its body is \nwet until its bean pastes flow out. \nAdditionally, bathing can clean the dirt on the body, \nbut it is necessary to keep an eye on the \nintelligence if the pool presents.
Fights between yukkuri
Although yukkuri forbid killing among their own kind, \nconflict itself is not rare to witness. \nIt happens when scummy yukkuri want to prove that \nit can [take it easy] because they have a strong desire to put other \nyukkuri underneath. The cause of the conflicts is mostly due to the \nappearance, and yukkuri are highly aggressive to the one \nwho lost its accessory. They mainly use their bodies to confront, \nand they feel either happy or sad after getting a win or a loss. \nWhen an extremely scummy yukkuri wins, it may \nmake the defeated yukkuri a poo-poo slave. \nA poo-poo slave is only allowed to eat poo-poo, \nand it must remain on guard even when the slave owner \nis sleeping, is it because of the enormous amount of \ntrauma being implanted when being defeated? \nIt is a taboo to kill their own kind, but there \nis an exception if it is a punishment on \nthe yukkuri that has committed murder. \n\nAlso, an extremely scummy father yukkuri may [thin out] \nthe unborn yukkuri on the stalk if they are not the \nsame type as the scum yukkuri.
Extra notes
On marriage\nYukkuri cherish marriages, but they may divorce \nwhen the partner misbehaves too many times \nor being separated to breed for a long period of time. \nAlso, a parent-child relationship could become \nmarriage when there is no other yukkuri presents. \n\nOn raper \nWhen yukkuri has extremely high libido, it may \nbecome a raper, and will remain as such until its \nlibido gets relieved. A raper refreshes with any \nyukkuri that are around itself. The transformation on Marisa or \nReimu types can be neglected, but Alice type is prone \nto become raper. A simple method to avoid becoming raper \nis castration, or helping yukkuri on relieving its libido. \n\n
