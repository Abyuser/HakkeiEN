(While looking for wild yukkuri, suddenly rain started to fall.)
(You find an old hut in the midst of searching for shelter,\nwhich looks like a good place to hide in.)
(You search for the owner, but it appears to be empty.)
(A large number of books seems to be piled up all over the place……)
(You take a couple of them to check the insides,\nhowever bugs ate the pages making them unreadable.)

Mukyu? Is someone there?
……
Oh my, a mister human? What could you do here?
(From the shadows, Patchouli appears.)
